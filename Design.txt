This system first retrieves the string(containing the weather report in XML format) using the urllib.request module.
After retrieving the string, it parses it using methods from xml.etree.ElementTree and extract the needed data into a dictionary object.
The data extracted contains three entries
    temp: the temperature in Celsius.
    time: the time when the temperature is recorded
    day: the day when the temperature is recorded
If there is an excel file named weather_report.xlsx in the directory of the system, It opens it using the openpyxl module.
If not, it creates a new file named weather_report.xlsx.

If there is a sheet whose name is equal to the value of the day entry from the data, then the data is entered into that sheet.
If not, it creates a sheet whose name is equal to the value of the day entry from the data and creates the header on the first row.
The header looks like this:
Time | Temperature (Celsius)
On the rest of the rows are the data entries formatted like this
12:10 | 10.6
Then the system enters the data into the sheet and saves it.
